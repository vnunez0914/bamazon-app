# BAMAZON

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

# How to use Bamazon

1. Bamazon will ask the user to select an item_id for the product that they would like to purchase. Then it will ask for how many units they would like to purchase. 

2. If the item is in stock Bamazon will give the user the total amount and update the product inventory. If there is no inventory left Bamazon will notify user.

3. In order to run Bamazon you will need to install the following npm packages. 

   * [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)

   * [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

   * [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)

   
 3. Type node bamazonCustomer.js to execute inquirer prompt.
